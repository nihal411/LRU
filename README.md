# LRU Cache Visualizer

A simple web application built to understand the internal working of an *LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache*.
Instead of stopping at theory, I implemented it to understand the internal working better.
Built a small web application to visualize:
## What it Shows
- Cache order from *Most Recently Used* to *Least Recently Used*
- Automatic eviction when cache capacity is full
- Use of *HashMap + Doubly Linked List* for *O(1)* operations
Cache ordering (most → least recently used)
Eviction when capacity is full
Use of HashMap + Doubly Linked List for O(1) operations

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learning
This hands-on approach made the concept much clearer.
This project was built as part of learning *Data Structures*, focusing on practical implementation over theory.
